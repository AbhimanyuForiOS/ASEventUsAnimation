How you will you  Configure this animation in to your existing Project.



STEP 1 :-
Download this Project "ChallengeAnimation" in to your mac system and open it in to "XCode 9.0" and above.


STEP 2 :-
Copy "PrefixHeader.pch"  and paste it in your existing Project where you want to implement this animation.
Go to Project and search Project->Settings->Prefix Header and then set "../ChallengeAnimation/PrefixHeader.pch" there on Path.


STEP 3 :-
Drag the whole "ChallengeAnimation" yellow Folder from "ChallengeAnimation" Project to your existing Xcode Project where you want to implement it.

That's it for animation files set up!!


STEP 4 :-
Create  An UIViewController and give name  “AnimationVc”.
Xcode will Create AnimationVc.h & AnimationVc.m files.

Now you have to Do 2 things :- 

STEP 4.1 :-  In to AnimationVc.h file create main property of animation view.
@interface ASMainVc : UIViewController 
@property(retain,nonatomic)CView *v ; 
@end

STEP 4.2:- in AnimationVc.m file set some functions.

`@implementation ASMainVc

@synthesize v;

#pragma mark: View Life Cycle
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [ControllerConfig setUpNav:self];
    //start animation
    v = [[CView alloc]initWithConfig:[[MainConfig alloc]init] onView:self.view];
}

#pragma mark: Memory Management Method
- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {
    [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
}

#pragma mark:Hide Status Bar
-(BOOL)prefersStatusBarHidden{
      return true;
}`

Now you can set this view in front of any navigation controller flow of your application and it will load your animation.


Happy Coding!!!
